## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-community-health.git
   cd ai-community-health

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

## Requirements
  - Node.js (v14 or above)
  - NPM (or Yarn)
  - API keys from any of the supported platforms:
    - OpenAI API Key
    - Google Gemini API Key
    - Anthropic Claude API Key
   

## Setup
Before you start using the tool, ensure that you have an API key from one of the supported platforms. When prompted by the CLI, you will need to provide the key.

If you wish to set up the key as an environment variable (optional), you can do so as follows:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    export CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key

Alternatively, the CLI will prompt you for the API key during runtime.


## Usage
To run the project and start generating the community health files, follow these steps:

1. Start the CLI tool:
   ```bash
   node index.js

2. You will be prompted to select one of the AI platforms:
    - OpenAI 
    - Google Gemini
    - Anthropic Claude
       
3. Enter your API key for the selected platform when prompted.
4. Answer the subsequent questions about your repository (e.g., owner name, license type, assignees for issue templates, etc.).
5. The tool will generate the following files within the appropriate directories of your repository.
Once completed, the generated files will be available in the `.github` and `docs` directories.
